\section{Problem Statement}
\subsection{What problem are you trying to solve?}

\newcommand*\apos{\textsc{\char13}}
Nowadays, more and more people around the world start to concern the food's 
healthy problems. Fast food which contain too much calories would be seen 
as unhealthy. Fruits and vegetables can give people nutrients to maintain 
health, feel good and have energy are highly recommended. But there are so many
kinds of food around, people can not identify healthy food in a quick and 
simple manner. So what I'm trying to do is build an mobile app called 
HealthyFood which can recognize the food on an image and show us whether it is 
healthy or not. 

\subsection{Why is this an import problem?}
Everybody has to eat. We can get more out of life, feel better and live longer 
by eating healthy food. Eating well can improves our body weight and shape, 
blood pressure and cholesterol levels. On the other hand, poor nutrition can 
impair our daily health and well being and reduce our ability to lead an 
enjoyable and active life. So healthy food indeed is an import problem we have 
to be cautions with.

\subsection{What is the context of the problem you are solving?}
HealthyFood is an iOS app which can only runs on Apple devices. It can be used 
by all ages. The app utilizes the cutting-edge Apple technology on machine 
learning and ready-to-use models which makes mobile devices can do machine 
learning task really fast. It doesn't need internet connection to work, so it's 
also good for user privacy.\\A special subset of stakeholders worth mentioning 
is the developers who has interest in machine learning and want to know how to 
do machine learning task on mobile platform.
