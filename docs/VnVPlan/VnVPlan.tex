This document provides the information on validation and verification plans implemented for the \progname{} software. In this regard,the general approaches and plans are initially discussed and afterwards specific test cases and approaches for validation and verification of functional and nonfunctional requirements (can be found in \href{https://github.com/shmouses/SPDFM/tree/master/docs/SRS}{SRS}) are reviewed. VnV plans here are a combination of manual (assigned to a member of the VnV team to assess) and automated testing approaches to evaluate the correctness of the information (whether input or output) or satisfaction of a goal in \progname{}.    

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

The \progname{} software, which its VnV plan is discussed in this document, is a software for calculating plasmon-enhanced electric field and electric current in a meshed geometry. This software should be able to setup an optical source (given the related parameters) and study how electric field and current densities in the dielectric are affected. The calculations in this software are based on the newly established theory of surface plasmon oscillations, nonlocal hydrodynamic theory of surface plasmons \cite{hiremath2012numerical}.   

\subsection{Objectives}
\label{obj}

This document tries to address the most important areas of the \progname{} software that can act like bottle necks of the system and make sure these areas function properly. In this regard, following chapters will discuss how these key aspects which include, setting up a light source, having properly meshed geometry, well defined dielectric environment, and theoretical formulation used. These areas are reflected within the functional and nonfunctional system requirements in Chapter 5 of the \href{https://github.com/shmouses/SPDFM/tree/master/docs/SRS}{SRS} document.  
In this software some python libraries are implemented such as FEniCS and Meshio which their validity is accepted will not be checked here. 

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

The relevant documentation for \progname{}, including the problem statement (\cite{SPDFMdoc22:online}), SRS (\cite{SPDFMdoc90:online}), SRS checklist (\cite{BlankPro77:online}), VnV report, MG, and MIS can be found in the devoted \href{https://github.com/shmouses/SPDFM}{GitHub repository} to this software. For theoretical aspects \cite{hiremath2012numerical}, \cite{monk2003finite}, and \cite{maier2007plasmonics} are the major important resources used in this software.  


\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

The VnV team in this work includes S. Shayan Mousavi M., responsible for reviewing all the documentations, providing test cases and their execution, verifying the theoretical aspects and their implementation; Dr. Spencer Smiths (CAS741 instructor), and S. Parsa Tayefeh Morsal (domain expert), responsible for reviewing the design of the software, all documentations, and the documenting style itself; Naveen Ganesh Muralidharan (secondary reviewer) responsible for reviewing SRS document; Siddharth (Sid) Shinde (secondary reviewer) responsible for reviewing VnV document; Gabriela Sánchez Díaz (secondary reviewer) responsible for reviewing MG and MIS documents. The theoretical aspects and finite element method implemented in \progname{} is verified by Dr. Gianluigi Botton (supervisor), and Dr. Alexander Pofelski (field expert contributor).



\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

The \progname{} shall be verified in the following ways:\\
\\
 Initial reviews from assigned members of the VnV team (Dr. Spencer Smith, S. Parsa Tayefeh Morsal, Naveen Ganesh Muralidharan, and Shayan Mousavi). In this regard, the document shall be manually reviewed using the \href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/smiths/cas741/-/blob/master/BlankProjectTemplate/docs/SRS/SRS-Checklist.pdf}{SRS checklist} (\cite{BlankPro77:online}) upon its initial version.\\
 \\
 Secondary review by the author (Shayan Mousavi). The SRS document shall be reviewed after receiving initial reviews, and completion of \href{https://github.com/shmouses/SPDFM/tree/master/docs/VnV}{VnV} document.\\  
 \\
 Final review by the author (Shayan Mousavi) and the instructor (Dr. Spencer Smith). The document shall be manually reviewed according to the  \href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/smiths/cas741/-/blob/master/BlankProjectTemplate/docs/SRS/SRS-Checklist.pdf}{SRS checklist} (\cite{BlankPro77:online})  after MG and MIS development.\\ 
 \\
 Review of theoretical aspects by the field experts (Dr. Gianluigi Botton, Dr. Alexander Pofelski, and Shayan Mousavi). Theories used in the SRS document shall be reviewed manually with respect to the governing relations in the realm of plasmonic physics (\cite{maier2007plasmonics}, \cite{hiremath2012numerical}, \cite{monk2003finite}).\\
 \\ 
 Feedback received from interested contributors through issue tracker in GitHub platform will also be used to improve this document. 
 

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

The design shall be verified by ensuring that key aspects in \progname{} are, as listed in Section \ref{obj}. In this regard, the system functional requirements shall be tested initially, as outlined in \ref{func}, and in following the nonfunctional requirements will be review, as outlined in \ref{nonfunc}.

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

The implementation shall be verified in the following ways:\\
\\
Code Walkthrough by author:  Module unit code shall be inspected for functional errors by the author (Shayan Mousavi) after MIS document is developed.\\  
\\
Code Walkthrough by contributors: Module unit code shall be inspected for functional errors by Dr. Alexander Pofelski after MIS document is developed.\\
\\
System Tests:  System tests will be carried out as listed in Section \ref{systest}. The functional and nonfunctional requirements shall be by those listed in the outline of each test. These tests are conducted either manually or automatically which is outlined for each test individual in Chapter \ref{systest}. 

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

By predetermining some user inputs, an automated testing approach can be
considered. The most of the functional requirement system tests will be executed and
validated automatically; these tests are outlined in Section \ref{func}. The goal of testing is $100\%$ code coverage. However, some system tests () require at least a manual assessment of the test results and
are thus removed from the automated scope.
\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\rule{1.1cm}{0pt}mesh file (.msh): A meshed sphere of 12 nm diameter

Output: .vtk 3D intensity map of the meshed geometry

Test Case Derivation: Similar input shall be fed to the MNPBEM toolbox in  MATLAB and the electric field enhancement be extracted for the 3D meshed geometry. As MNPBEM uses boundary element method to calculate a quasi-static approximation of the Maxwell's equations it is not expected to have exactly the same results. However, as both nonlocal hydrodynamic theory and quasi-static theory trying to solve similar equations roughly similar behaviour on the surface of the structure is expected.     

How test will be performed: Shayan Mousavi is responsible for executing both SPDFM and MNPBEM simulations. Shayan Mousavi, Dr. Gianluigi Botton, and Dr. Alex Pofelski are responsible for evaluating how these two responses are close.

	Initial State: Maintainability of the repository and external toolboxes used in this software such as FEniCS has not been tested.
	
	Input/Condition: production version of \progname{} has been released.
	
	Output/Result: A graded report describing the maintainability of the repository
	
	How test will be performed: Dr. Alexander Pofelski shall check the repository for the following documentation:  SRS, VnV Plan, MG, MIS, User Guide. He shall mark 1 point for each of the above documents. He shall read through each of the above documents and
	provide a grade between 1 and 5 for clarity of the writing. A score of 1 represents a document that is hard to understand, and a score of 5 represents a document that is easy to understand. The user should also grade the traceability of each document. A score of 1 represents no links within the report, and a score of 5 represents many links between sections of the report. The user shall then divide the sum of the scores for all of the reports by 5.
	 A final average grade of 3 will indicate that the users found the system to have average Maintainability. The higher the score,the better the perception of Maintainability. This approach is suggested by \cite{LatticeB41:online}.

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{Reference your MIS and explain your overall philosophy for test case
  selection.}  
\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS has
  been completed.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed: 
					
\item{test-id2\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed: 

\item{...\\}
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Module 2}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}

\subsubsection{Module ?}

\section{Appendix}

This is where you can place additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.
